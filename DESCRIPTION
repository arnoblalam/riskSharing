Description: An analysis of risk sharing networks in a village in Tanzania.  
                Participants were asked ‘Can you give a list of people from 
                inside or outside of Nyakatoke, who you can personally rely on 
                for help and/or that can rely on you for help in cash, kind 
                or labour?’  We turn their answers into networks between 
                households and report on some basic structure of the network.
